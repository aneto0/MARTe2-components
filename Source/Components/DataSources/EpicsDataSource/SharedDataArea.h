 * @brief Interprocess shared data area handle.
 *
 * @details This class is a handle to an interprocess shared memory area meant
 * for interchanging sigblocks between two processes. It offers access through
 * two different interfaces, one for consuming and another for producing. By
 * requirement, this class does not have to buffer a queue of sigblocks, it is
 * enough maintaining a double buffer, as long as it assures that the consumer
 * always gets the fresher sigblock put by the producer.
 *
 * @warning If this class is going to be used by two different applications,
 * then both shall be compiled with the same compiler and version, otherwise
 * bugs could show up at run time (mainly those related to padding between
 * data members).

    /*
     * Implementation details:
     *   The implementation of this class relies on a fixed representation
     *   of the shared memory area which has to be only managed by this
     *   class. A private structure called Representation is used for
     *   representing that shared memory and managing its initialization and
     *   other stuff.
     *   Trick nº1: The interfaces SigblockConsumer and SigblockProducer
     *   both inherit privately from the Representation structure, so they
     *   do not need to hold a private member pointer to the shared memory
     *   area. That implies that no instances of them are going to be created,
     *   instead they are mapped to the shared memory area itself.
     *   Trick nº2: The Representation structure has a tail data member that
     *   is an array of chars with no elements (SDA::char8 member[]), which does
     *   not increase the size of the structure, but it allows to access the
     *   memory allocated beyond the end of the structure. This is needed
     *   because the number of signals is unknown at compile time and extra
     *   space is allocated for them at run time.
     *
     *   Implementation warning nº1:
     *     It is essential to not add the following C++ features to classes
     *     mapped to the shared memory area (Representation, SigblockConsumer,
     *     and SigblockProducer):
     *       · Member pointers
     *       · Virtual methods
     *       · Virtual inheritance
     *     The reason behind that is that each instance of this class will be
     *     executing on different processes and, although accessing the same
     *     shared memory area, they will use different memory address spaces.
     *     So, using features that add pointers to the object (implicitly as a
     *     virtual table or explicit as as a data member pointers), it will
     *     make the program to crash by segmentation fault or data corruption.
     *
     *   Implementation warning nº2:
     *     Related to the trick nº2, the existence of a special tail member
     *     in the Representation structure means that classes that inherit
     *     from Representation, like SigblockConsumer and SigblockProducer
     *     can not have any data members or the Representation's tail will
     *     overlap with them.
