 * @brief A DataSource which receives given signals via UDP with Multicast support.
 *
 * The configuration syntax is (names are only given as an example):
 * +UDPReceiver = {
 *     Class = UDPDrv::UDPReceiver
 *     Address = "230.168.129.30" //Optional. Only for Multicast group
 *     Port = "44488" //Optional. Default: 44488
 *     Timeout = "5.0" //Optional (seconds) The time the receiver will wait while listening before timing out. Default: Infinite
 *     ExecutionMode = RealTimeThread//Optional (default RealTimeThread)
 *       If ExecutionMode == IndependentThread a thread is spawned to read from the socket and the memory copy is immediate (i.e. it will not block).
 *       If ExecutionMode == RealTimeThread the DataSource socket read is blocking and handled in the context of the real-time thread.
 *     CPUMask = 0x1
 *     StackSize = 10000000
 *     Signals = {
 *          Signal2 = {
 *             Type = uint32 //Any MARTe2 type
 *          }
 *          ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * The Signals section is in practice a description of the structure of the UDP Packet read.
