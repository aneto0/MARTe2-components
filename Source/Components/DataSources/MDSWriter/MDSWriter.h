 * @brief A DataSourceI interface which allows to store signals in an MDSplus database.
 *
 * @details Data written into this data source is temporarily stored in a circular buffer and
 * asynchronously flushed to the MDSplus database in the context of a separate thread.
 * This circular buffer can either be continuously stored or stored only when a given event occurs (see StoreOnTrigger below).
 *
 * This DataSourceI has the functions FlushSegments and OpenTree registered as an RPC.
 *
 * The configuration syntax is (names are only given as an example):
 * +MDSWriter_0 = {
 *     Class = MDSWriter
 *     NumberOfBuffers = 10 //Compulsory. Number of buffers in the circular buffer defined above. Each buffer is capable of holding a copy of all the DataSourceI signals.

 *     StackSize = 10000000 //Compulsory. Stack size of the thread above.
 *     TreeName = "mds_m2test" //Compulsory. Name of the MDSplus tree.
 *     PulseNumber = 1 //Optional. If -1 a new pulse will be created and the MDSplus pulse number incremented.

 *     EventName = "updatejScope" //Compulsory. Event sent to jScope when TimeRefresh seconds have elapsed.
 *     TimeRefresh = 5 //Compulsory. An event with the name set in the property EventName is sent to jScope when TimeRefresh seconds have elapsed.

 *     NumberOfPostTriggers = 1 //Compulsory iff StoreOnTrigger = 1.  Number of cycles to store after the trigger.
