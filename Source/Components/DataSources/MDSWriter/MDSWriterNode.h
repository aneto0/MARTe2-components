 * When the number of time samples is deemed sufficient, an MDS+ segment is created and all the shared memory data is

 * IsUseTimeVector() == true, when a discontinuity on the time signal is detected, i.e., when the distance between
 *  two time samples is greater than GetExecutePeriodMicroSecond.
