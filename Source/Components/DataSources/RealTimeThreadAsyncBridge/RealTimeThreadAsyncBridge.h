/**
 * @brief Allows to share asynchronously signals among two or more real time threads.
 *
 * @details For each signal, the writer GAM finds the oldest available buffer written to write on and after the write operation
 * it sets it as the newest. The reader GAMs attempt to read on the newest written available buffer. The mutual access between readers and
 * writer is guaranteed by spinlock semaphores, one for each buffer of each signal. If no buffer is available for the writer, the GetOutputOffset
 * function returns false. The same happens if there is no buffer available for the reader (impossible if more than one buffer has been declared),
 * in this case the GetInputOffset returns false.
 *
 * @details In addiction to the standard non-blocking mode, user can define BlockingMode. If BlockingMode is declared greater than 0, only one buffer will be used.
 * If BlockingMode==1, the access on each signal is regulated by a dedicated signal spinlock mutex.
 * If BlockingMode==2, the access to all the signals is regulated by a global spinlock mutex. This can be used to ensure consistency between signals for instance
 * in communication between two GAMs belonging to different threads.
 *
 * The RPC method ResetSignalValue allows to reset all the signal values.

 *    ResetMSecTimeout = 1 //Optional. Default = TTInfiniteWait. The TerminateOutputCopy function can block when the counter used to newest written buffer overflows and needs to be reset.
