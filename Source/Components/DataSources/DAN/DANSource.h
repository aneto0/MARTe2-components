 * @brief A DataSourceI which allows to store signals in an ITER DAN database.
 *
 * @details Data written into this data source is temporarily stored in a circular buffer and
 * asynchronously flushed to the DAN database in the context of a separate thread.
 * This circular buffer can either be continuously stored or stored only when a given event occurs (see StoreOnTrigger below).
 *
 * This DataSourceI has the functions OpenStream and CloseStream registered as an RPC.
 *
 * The configuration syntax is (names are only given as an example):
 * <pre>
 * +DANSource_0 = {
 *     Class = DAN::DANSource
 *     NumberOfBuffers = 10 //Compulsory. Number of buffers in the circular buffer defined above. Each buffer is capable of holding a copy of all the DataSourceI signals.
 *     CPUMask = 15 //Compulsory. Affinity assigned to the threads responsible for asynchronously flush data into the DAN database.
 *     StackSize = 10000000 //Compulsory. Stack size of the thread above.
 *     DanBufferMultiplier = 4 //Compulsory. Number of buffers that the dan_publisher_publishSource_withDAQBuffer will use to buffer the data written by the DataSourceI
 *     StoreOnTrigger = 1 //Compulsory. If 0 all the data in the circular buffer is continuously stored. If 1 data is stored when the Trigger signal is 1 (see below).
 *     NumberOfPreTriggers = 2 //Compulsory iff StoreOnTrigger = 1.  Number of cycles to store before the trigger.
 *     NumberOfPostTriggers = 1 //Compulsory iff StoreOnTrigger = 1.  Number of cycles to store after the trigger.
 *     ICProgName = "MARTeApp.ex" //Optional. If set it will call dan_initLibrary_icprog with the specified name.
 *     Interleave = 1 //Optional. If == 1 => that the data is expected to be interleaved by the DANStream, if == 0, it can be assumed that the data is already interleaved.
 *     FullStreamName = 0 //Optional. If == 1 all the streams are named as [data source name]_T[period]_N[number of samples]_[type]

 *                            //When not set (i.e. when no TimeSignal is defined) the time will computed as the absolute time at the latest state change (given by tcn_get_time) + the number of cycles multiplied by the signal Period (or 1/SamplingFrequency)
 *             AbsoluteTime = 0 //Optional. If 1 the Type shall be uint64 or int64 and the absolute time given by this signal will be used to time stamp the samples.
 *                              //          If 0 and TimeSignal = 1 the time will computed as the absolute time at the latest state change (given by tcn_get_time) + the time given by this time signal (which is assumed to be relative).
 *         }
 *         SignalUInt16F = { //As many as required.
 *             Period = 1e-3 //Compulsory if SamplingFrequency not set. Period between signal samples.
 *             SamplingFrequency = 1000 //Compulsory if Period not set. 1/Period between signal samples.
 *         }
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * A DANStream instance will be created for every different signal_type/sampling_frequency pair. Signals must be listed in the same order as they appear on the DAN xml.
