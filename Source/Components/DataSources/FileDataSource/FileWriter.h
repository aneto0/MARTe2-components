/**
 * @brief A DataSourceI interface which allows to store signals in a file.
 *
 * @details Data written into this data source is temporarily stored in a circular buffer and
 * asynchronously flushed to a file either as text (csv) or binary. This circular buffer can either be
 * continuously stored or stored only when a given event occurs (see StoreOnTrigger below).
 *
 * All the signals are stored in a single file.
 * If the format is csv the first line will be a comment with each signal name, type and number of elements.
 * e.g."#Trigger (uint8)[1];Time (uint32)[1];SignalUInt8 (uint8)[1];SignalUInt16 (uint16)[4]", where ; is the CSVSeparator.
 * A new line will be added every time all the signal samples are written.
 * The default number formats for a csv file are "%u" for unsigned integers, "%d" for signed integers and "%f" for floats.
 * A custom format can be chosen for each signal via the parameter "Format" (see signal SignalUInt16F in the example below) 
 *
 * If the format is binary an header with the following information is created: the first 4 bytes
 * contain the number of signals. Then, for each signal, the signal type will be encoded in two bytes, followed
 *  by 32 bytes to encode the signal name, followed by 4 bytes which store the number of elements of a given signal.
 *  Following the header the signal samples are consecutively stored in binary format.
 *
 * This DataSourceI has the functions FlushFile, OpenFile and CloseFile registered as RPCs.
 *
 * Only one and one GAM is allowed to write into this DataSourceI.
 *
 * The configuration syntax is (names are only given as an example):
 *
 * <pre>
 * +FileWriter_0 = {
 *     Class = FileWriter
 *     NumberOfBuffers = 10 //Compulsory. Number of buffers in the circular buffer defined above. Each buffer is capable of holding a copy of all the DataSourceI signals.
 *     CPUMask = 0xFEu //Compulsory. Affinity assigned to the threads responsible for asynchronously flush data into the file.
 *     StackSize = 10000000 //Compulsory. Stack size of the thread above.
 *     Filename = "test.bin" //Optional. If not set the filename shall be set using the OpenFile RPC.
 *     Overwrite = "yes" //Compulsory. If "yes" the file will be overwritten, otherwise new data will be added to the end of the existent file. If FileFormat is "binary", Overwrite must be "yes" because binaries can not be appended.
 *     FileFormat = "binary" //Compulsory. Possible values are: binary and csv.
 *     CSVSeparator = "," //Compulsory if Format=csv. Sets the file separator type.
 *     StoreOnTrigger = 1 //Compulsory. If 0 all the data in the circular buffer is continuously stored. If 1 data is stored when the Trigger signal is 1 (see below).
 *     RefreshContent = 0 //Optional. If set, new data will always overwrite old data, keeping always the last snapshot. Also enables header pretty-printing, which is referred as "Full Notation".
 *     NumberOfPreTriggers = 2 //Compulsory iff StoreOnTrigger = 1.  Number of cycles to store before the trigger.
