/**
 * @brief Triggers MARTe::Message events on the basis of commands received in the input signals.
 *
 * @details This GAM must contain a ReferenceContainer called "Events" containing EventConditionTrigger objects (see EventConditionTrigger).
 * The EventConditionTrigger objects can be configured to send messages based on a combination of specific values of the GAM input signals.
 *
 * @details The input signals can be variables or commands. A command must be declared with a name that begins with the prefix "Command".
 * When a command changes, the MessageGAM interrogates all the contained EventConditionTrigger and messages are sent if the specified conditions are
 * matched. In output this GAM provides the number of the messages waiting for reply for each command.\n
 * The GAM has two main behaviour modes, which can be controlled using the TriggerOnChange option:
 * - TriggerOnChange enabled: the GAM must see a change in its command value input during its state lifecycle. Seeing a change during a state lifecycle means
 *                            that every state change (e.g. PrepareNextState) the GAM stores the current value to wait for a change happening in the future, by comparing
 *                            past value with current, during that specific state context. In other words, the GAM has to see and "edge" in the command value to trigger a message.
 * - TriggerOnChange disabled: the GAM does not need to see an edge in command value to trigger the message, even across state changes.
 * As the GAM keeps track of sent messages and received replies, if the message sent as a consequence of a triggering event is still awaiting for a reply, no further message will
 * be sent until the reply acknowledgement.
 * Constraints:\n
 *   [number of commands] == [number of output signals]
 *   [output signals type] == uint32
 *
 * @details Follows an example of configuration:
 * <pre>
 *   +GAM1 = {
 *       Class = MessageGAM 
 *       TriggerOnChange = 1 //Defaults to 1 = true if not present. Allowed values 0 == false or disabled, != 0 == true or enabled (see above)
 *       +Events = {
 *           Class = ReferenceContainer
 *           +Event1 = {
 *               Class = EventConditionTrigger
 *               EventTrigger = {
 *                   Command1 = 1
 *                   Signal1 = 2 //Command == 1 and Signal1 == 2 must be true to trigger the condition.
 *               }
